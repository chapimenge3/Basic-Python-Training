# Project Title: Simple Address Book

Project Description: In this project, we will create a simple address book program using Python. The
program will allow the user to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts in the address book. We are
going to use
    - use Tkinter for GUI and File I/O for storing data
    - use Virtual Environment for this project.
    - use some of the concepts we learned in Week 2.

## Requirements

1. The program should use object-oriented programming principles and create a Contact class with
attributes such as name, phone number, email, and address.
2. The program should provide a menu-driven interface to allow the user to add, edit, delete, or search
for contacts.
3. The program should store the contacts in a file, and the user should be able to save and load the
contacts to/from the file.
4. The program should include error handling to handle exceptions such as invalid user input.
5. This project will cover various Python basics such as class and objects, file handling, and error
handling.
